Problem statement:
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.
Using the model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.


Hypothesis:
1) City type: Stores located in urban or Tier 1 cities should have higher sales because of the higher income levels of people there.
2) Population Density: Stores located in densely populated areas should have higher sales because of more demand
3) Customer Behavior: Stores keeping the right set of products to meet the local needs of customers will have higher sales.Healthy foods have more sales
4)Competitors: Stores having similar establishments nearby should have less sales because of more competition.
5)Store size: Supermarkets have more sales
6)Advertising: Better advertising of products in the store will higher sales in most cases.
7) Promotional Offer: Discounts/Promotional offers attract more customers and increase sales
8) Online shopping portal: If a store has online shopping portal with home delivery services sales will increase
9) Store with Pharmacy: More sales

Goals:
Based on the dataset create a model to how the products and stores influence sales and determine the factors that impact increased sales.


Limitations:

Initial analysis of the data indicate few key data points that are missing which may not help with testing all the hypothesis provided above.

Strong identifiers in the dataset:
*Food product types- Healthy vs Regular
*Store size
* Store type
*Store establishment year
*Prices
